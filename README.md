I am a senior frontend developer at Boxine GmbH in Duesseldorf, Germany. I bring ideas to life from wireframe sketches to functional prototypes to polished features. With a background in sales and expert web frontend development skills I helped to build products for corporations, e-commerce startups, digital agencies and various client during my freelance career. I am a strong believer in the MVP approach with quick iterations, early testing and continuous shipping.

Occasionally I write about web development. I only published three articles in the recent past. I hope to find the time to bring more ideas to paper in the future.
