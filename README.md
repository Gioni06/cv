üëã Hi, I'm Jonas. Thanks for coming by.

I'm a senior software engineer with a strong focus on modern front-end development and architecture. I'm with Northern Data AG to help with scaling our engineering team and create a custom-tailored solution to manage our data center operations across the globe.

I care deeply about software engineering culture and practices that help teams build better products. Currently, I'm learning a lot about Domain-Driven Design and hexagonal software architectures.

If you know books, talks, or resources that you can recommend, just [drop me a line](mailto:jonas.duri@gmail.com). These are some of the books that greatly influence my work.

- Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization <small>by Dave Logan, John King, Halee Fischer-Wright</small>
- No Rules Rules <small>by Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer</small>
- Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love <small>by Marty Cagan</small>
- Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know <small>by Adam Grant</small>
- Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship <small>by Robert C. Martin</small>
- Phoenix Project: A Novel about It, Devops, and Helping Your Business Win <small>Gene Kim</small>

Sometimes I find the time to write down some thoughts on Medium.

- [Building A Landing Page With Webpack 4] (Outdated by now, don't quote me on this)
